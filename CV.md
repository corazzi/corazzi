## Professional Summary
I am a Senior Full Stack Software Engineer with over a decade of experience building, maintaining, and scaling software solutions across healthcare, retail, and the public sector. 

My core expertise lies in Laravel and Vue, though I am more than comfortable with PHP and JavaScript as languages in their own right. I have used PHP professionally since 5.2 and seen the language and ecosystem mature. I am keen on keeping up-to-date with the latest versions of languages, frameworks, and tooling.

Over the years, I have led projects that range from high-traffic consumer-facing APIs to complex NHS integrations, while also mentoring junior developers, establishing CI/CD pipelines, and driving digital innovation.

My career reflects a consistent focus on solving real-world problems. I like to take ownership of projects to the point I'm able to become dedicated to their evolution and successes.

I pride myself on writing comprehensive pull requests and documentation that provide clear and easy to follow setup and testing guidelines.

My contributions helped the agency earn recognition as a Shopify Plus Expert.

I helped develop a custom CLI tool that replaced Shopifyâ€™s Slate framework, significantly streamlining theme deployment for the digital team. I also built and maintained integrations that supported both consumer-facing and B2B systems, covering stock management, fulfilment, and customer retention.

Key projects included the licensing platform used by major UK retailers such as Asda, Home Bargains, and Morrisons; an online leadership learning platform built with Laravel, Vue, and Nova; Tottenham Hotspurâ€™s BigCommerce-powered store; and a range of Shopify solutions for brands such as Turnbull & Asser, Chinti & Parker, Barry M, and Deliveroo.

OrangeBus was a full-service digital agency based in Newcastle upon Tyne. They have since been acquired by Capita.

At OrangeBus, I worked as a consultant developer on mid-to-large-scale projects for both private and public sector clients. For Argon Telecom, I contributed to their top-up platform built with Symfony, ensuring performance and reliability in a high-volume transactional environment in Kenya where mobile reception was sparse. I also worked with the Skills Funding Agency, developing a GOV.uk platform to support education and employment initiatives, using Sitefinity as the primary CMS. This experience deepened my understanding of working within government standards for accessibility and usability.

As Development Director at Mobius Media, I led a team of between six and ten developers while driving the companyâ€™s digital strategy.

I was responsible for infrastructure as well as software, managing dedicated servers and VPSs across Hetzner, Digital Ocean, and in-house hardware. I set up and maintained CI/CD pipelines for a wide range of projects, leveraging Bitbucket, GitHub, and GitLab.

Notable projects included Hull KR rugby clubâ€™s Shopify-powered store and WordPress website, a bespoke social network for parties and events, and a global asset-tracking and risk management platform.
